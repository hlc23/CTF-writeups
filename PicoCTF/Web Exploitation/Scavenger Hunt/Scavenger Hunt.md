## Problem
> There is some interesting information hidden around this site http://mercury.picoctf.net:44070/. Can you find it?


[link](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/161)
### Source
## Solution
1. Link to the website and open the developer tools to see the source code of HTML.
2. There is a comment in the source code that says  
    ```html
    <!-- Here's the first part of the flag: picoCTF{t -->
    ```
3. After checking the HTML, the next step is CSS and JavaScript. Open `mycss.css` to see if there is any useful.
In the CSS file, there is a comment that says
    ```css
    /* CSS makes the page look nice, and yes, it also has part of the flag. Here's part 2: h4ts_4_l0 */
    ```
4. Open `myjs.js` to see if there is any useful.
    ```js
    /* How can I keep Google from indexing my website? */
    ```
    This is a hint to check `robots.txt`.
    > tips: `robots.txt` is a file that tells web robots (most often search engines) which pages on your site to crawl. It also tells web robots which pages not to crawl.
5. Open `robots.txt` and we get 
    ```text
    # Part 3: t_0f_pl4c
    # I think this is an apache server... can you Access the next flag?
    ```
    there is a hint to check `.htaccess`.
    > tips: `.htaccess` is a config file for use on web servers running the Apache Web Server.
6. Open `.htaccess` and we get
    ```text
    # Part 4: 3s_2_lO0k
    # I love making websites on my Mac, I can Store a lot of information there.
    ```
    there is a hint to check `.DS_Store`.
    > tips: `.DS_Store` is a hidden file used to store folder data in macOS operating systems.
7. Open `.DS_Store` and we get
    ```text
    Congrats! You completed the scavenger hunt. Part 5: _7a46d25d}
