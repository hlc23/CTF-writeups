# It is my Birthday
## Problem
> I sent out 2 invitations to all of my friends for my birthday! I'll know if they get stolen because the two invites look similar, and they even have the same md5 hash, but they are slightly different! You wouldn't believe how long it took me to find a collision. Anyway, see if you're invited by submitting 2 PDFs to my website. http://mercury.picoctf.net:11590/

## Solution
According to the description, we need to upload to PDF file with same md5 hash. Google for it and I found these two file [erase](./erase) and [hello](./hello) from this [web](https://www.mscs.dal.ca/~selinger/md5collision/)  
Change the extension to `.pdf` and upload it to the website.
