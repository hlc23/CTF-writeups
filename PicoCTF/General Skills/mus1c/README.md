### Source
- [lyrics.txt](./lyrics.txt)
## Solution
In the hint it says `Do you think you can master rockstar?`.  
google the rockstar and I found this github repo [rockstar](https://github.com/RockstarLang/rockstar).  
In the repo has a link to the website [Rockstar](https://codewithrockstar.com/online).  
That website is a online compiler for rockstar language, so copy the lyrics and paste it in the website and run it.  
And get some numbers, convert it to ascii and get the flag.  
## flag
`picoCTF{rrrocknrn0113r}`
