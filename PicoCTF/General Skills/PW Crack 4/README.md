# PW Crack 4
## Problem
> Can you crack the password to get the flag?
Download the password checker [here](./level4.py) and you'll need the encrypted [flag](./level4.flag.txt.enc) and the [hash](./level4.hash.bin) in the same directory too.
There are 100 potential passwords with only 1 being correct. You can find these by examining the password checker script.
